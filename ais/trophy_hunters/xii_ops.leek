/**
 * TROPHY: XII (ID: 188) - 810,000 habs
 * GOAL: "Consume 12 12 12 12 12 operations in one fight"
 *
 * This likely means: Use exactly 1,212,121,212 operations total in a fight.
 * Or it could mean: Have 5 consecutive 12-something patterns.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: This AI tries to consume a precise amount of operations.
 *
 * NOTE: Each function call costs operations. We need to figure out
 * the exact target and calibrate.
 *
 * Hypothesis: The number 12121212 (12 repeated) or similar pattern.
